First I made a table and sized it with rows, columns
Then I added an event handler to each cell to make them clickable
I'm thinking that when I click each cell, I would like to see what is inside the cell
That worked!!!!
Now I need to change the color when I click
It only worked for the first td which means I'm only selecting the first td so i need to use querySelectorAll
okay so now all of my cells are green.  I need only each cell that I click on to be green
I made a ship class and added it to various cells
when i click on that cell, if there is a ship, it will show up
So my eventListener did not work so I used an onclick in the html and a function in the JS and the toggle method for my hidden class that has visibility: hidden
I was able to toggle the ship I put the toggle on, but the problem is that I can click anywhere on the page and the toggle works.
